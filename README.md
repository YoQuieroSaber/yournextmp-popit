# A PopIt frontend for sourcing candidate data

The idea of this project is to make a web-based front-end to
[PopIt](http://popit.poplus.org/) for crowd-sourcing candidates
for upcoming elections; it was used for
[YourNextMP](https://yournextmp.com) in the UK for the 2015
General Election.

The PopIt project is now being deprecated, so we will be
migrating this project (and existing sites) to use PostgreSQL as
the primary data store. There is a
[GitHub issue for tracking this work](https://github.com/mysociety/yournextrepresentative/issues/500)

Since that migration is still work in progress, if you
*urgently* need to create a YourNextRepresentative site, for
the moment it's best to still use PopIt.

This is alpha software still, so please
[get in touch with us](mailto:ynr@mysociety.org) to let us know
of your plans and hopefully we can provide support for your
project.

The following other documentation files may be of use to you,
depending on what you're trying to do:

* [A guide to setting up YourNextRepresentative for a new country](docs/new-instance.md)
  This is a work-in-progress, describing what's involved in
  setting up YourNextRepresentative in a new country.
* [Notes on setting up a dev version of YourNextMP with vagrant](docs/ynmp-vagrant.md)
  This was created to make it easy for developers and designers
  to get started working on YourNextMP (the UK site), and may be
  still be of some use.
